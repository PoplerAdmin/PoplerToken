Abstract: Digital tokens whose prices are pegged to fiat currencies (stablecoins) provide cryptocurrency markets with liquidity and individuals or organizations with an easy on-ramp for accessing digital assets. Algorithmically-pegged stablecoins can lose their peg due to issues in their value-defining logic or unexpected changes in the greater cryptocurrency market. Fiat-backed stablecoins have proven to be reliable platforms for maintaining user trust in cryptocurrency but also serve to build significant wealth for the managers of the token through the interest rates and leveraging of fiat reserves. We propose a stablecoin that maintains a one-to-one ratio between circulating tokens and an associated real-world fiat currency reserve while also re-distributing the wealth gained from the maintenance of those reserves for the benefit of all. This process begins with independent auditing of fiat reserves and regular reporting on the accrual of wealth by those reserve accounts. Accrued wealth is then redistributed via transparently reported donations to charities.

Introduction
Since their introduction, cryptocurrencies have provided users with the ability to transact directly with one another without the need for a facilitating third party. This trustless transfer of asset ownership provides users with the opportunity to transact with others regardless of borders and mostly separate from legacy banking systems. As cryptocurrencies have grown they have shown themselves to be an extremely volatile store of wealth making them a poor place to store one’s wealth for long periods of time. A class of cryptocurrencies called “stablecoins” emerged to address the volatility of crypto and provide users with a “safe” place to store their wealth.

Stablecoins comprise two categories, algorithmically-pegged and asset-pegged. Algorithmically-pegged stablecoins maintain a stable value by algorithmically managing the liquidity of the coin through the monitoring of a number of factors. While these tokens appeal to the truly trustless ideal behind cryptocurrency recent events where algorithmically-pegged stablecoins lost their peg have shown that, without active management, even stablecoins can fall victim to market volatility. Asset-pegged stablecoins derive their value from the assets held in reserve by that stablecoin’s parent organization. For example, a stablecoin that is backed at a one-to-one ratio by United States Dollars would have a value of $1 per token. Ideally this value will hold long as users of that stablecoin trust in the parent organization’s ability to maintain the one-to-one ratio. Unlike the trustless and decentralized ideal behind cryptocurrency, these asset-pegged tokens are inherently centralized requiring trust in the issuing organization.

Organizations that issue asset-backed stablecoins must build trust with users in order to maintain their peg. The most common ways that stablecoin issuers build trust are through the independent reporting of asset reserves and providing an user-friendly service for converting tokens into the underlying asset. If a large stablecoin loses user trust in its peg then users will move on to a more trustworthy token.

One of the perks provided to these asset-pegged stablecoins is that their massive reserves can be used to earn more money for the institution through the leveraging of funds or investment in speculative assets. In early 2022 it was revealed that Tether, the largest stablecoin by marketshare did not actually hold a one-to-one reserve of the underlying assets to back each Tether that had been distributed. Instead, nearly 80% of their reserves are held in illiquid or speculative assets that could impede Tether’s ability to re-pay users should there be a mass exodus as seen in classical bank runs. Should an event like this happen Tether will likely lose user trust and its peg.

Stablecoin organizations like Tether Operations Limited are not incentivized to maintain one-to-one reserves in liquid assets like cash because the potential return on investment is so great. With Tether’s current market cap of nearly $70 Billion even relatively small returns provide the organization with massive gains. For example, maintaining those reserves in a number of high-interest business accounts giving an annual percentage rate of 2.5% would earn Tether Operations Limited nearly $1.75 Billion annually. By investing in more speculative assets they are likely making significantly more money than this.

It is understandable for an organization that provides such a valuable tool for users to try to make money off of their efforts but these earnings come at a risk to the greater crypto market. Should something happen to the assets backing a coin like Tether it would lose its peg and likely bring the entire cryptocurrency market to its knees in illiquidity. It is for that reason that we believe it is necessary for there to be a stablecoin that provides users insurance that their funds will be available and that seeks to maintain the health of the markets over individual profit. In this paper we will describe Popler, an asset-pegged token that leverages many of the safety nets put in place to protect traditional brick-and-mortar banks to provide users with a trustworthy and transparent place to store their wealth on blockchain.Technology and Processes
Leveraging the Ethereum Network
Popler is an ERC20 token that lives on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum network has shown itself to be a robust platform for the trustless transfer of assets. By being an ERC20 token, Popler can take advantage of the many Layer 2 Decentralized Finance applications that run on the Ethereum network to reach a broad audience of users. ERC20 tokens are also widely accepted by the main cryptocurrency exchanges meaning users can use Popler as a store of wealth even if they are not using an Ethereum network wallet. Popler leverages the ERC20 open-source standards to maintain security and ensure long-term compatibility with future updates to the Ethereum network.

Flow of User Funds Process
Popler is pegged to the United States Dollar (USD) as it is widely accepted as the reserve currency of the world. Being backed by USD also allows Popler to take advantage of US monetary policy and banking insurance. In the future Popler may expand to other fiat currencies based on demand and issues with global interoperability. Popler is also funded entirely by the users with every Popler token in circulation being backed by USD received from the users themselves. The process for how user funds and Popler are distributed or redeemed can be described in five steps as seen in the diagram below.

Step 1: Funding of Reserves
The Popler USD reserves are funded by the transfer of user-provided USD into a Popler LLC reserve account. Each transaction into the reserves is tied to an issuance of Popler to ensure that funds in are equal to Popler in circulation.

Step 2: Issuance of Popler
Upon receipt of USD from a user Popler LLC will distribute an equivalent number of Popler minus Ethereum network transaction fees to the user’s desired Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.). Transactions on the Ethereum network require Gas to be paid in order to reward network node managers for the cost of maintaining their node and are necessary for any transaction on the Ethereum network. Some Ethereum wallets also request a small transaction fee to counteract the cost of maintaining the wallet. These fees are removed from the total amount of Popler provided so that the USD reserves remains positive after every issuance transaction.
Step 3: User Usage of Popler
Once a user has Popler within their account they can use it as they please just like any other ERC20 token. As stated before, being an ERC20 token allows users to take advantage of Layer 2 applications on the Ethereum network or DeFi markets.

Step 4: Redeeming of Popler
When a user wishes to pull their funds out of the cryptocurrency markets they are able to redeem their Popler tokens for USD much like how they had received tokens in the beginning. Popler is sent to a Popler LLC owned Ethereum network wallet where it is taken out of circulation. These transactions are what initiate a transfer of USD out of the Popler LLC managed reserve accounts.

Step 5: Return of User Funds
After a user’s Popler has been taken out of circulation the user will receive their USD funds in their desired bank account. This process may take time due to the speed of traditional banking but it is a reliable way to return funds back to users without accruing additional fees.

Asset Appreciation Funds Redistribution Process
As Popler grows in marketshare so too will the USD reserves it is pegged to. These reserves will gain interest provided by the traditional brick-and-mortar banks where these reserves are held. Since these reserves are built on users entrusting their hard-earned wealth in Popler we believe that it is imperative that any money earned through the maintenance of the reserves that is not needed for operational expenses should be given back to support our users and their communities.

To this end, profits will be donated to charities that seek to improve health and educational outcomes for communities around the world. In order to provide users with assurance that these funds are actually being used for what we say they are being used for each donation will only go to charities with an A- rating or better on CharityWatch.org. In the future, we hope to provide users the ability to nominate and vote on which charity they wish Popler LLC to donate to. This process is outlined in the diagram below.

Proof of Reserves Process
Building user trust is integral to maintaining a stablecoin’s peg, marketshare, and liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. For Popler to build user trust the circulation of Popler and the amount of USD reserves being held by Popler LLC must be entirely transparent. Providing proof that Popler LLC is maintaining a one-to-one ratio of USD reserves to Popler in circulation assures users that their Popler will maintain its value regardless of market conditions. For some users a statement from Popler LLC regarding the state of reserves will be enough to build trust but it is essential that users are 100% sure that they can rely on Popler. That means having regular independent auditing of the funds in Popler LLC’s USD reserve accounts. These audits would come at a regular cadence so that even in times of market turmoil users can be assured that the reserves exist as promised.

Mitigation of Market Risks
Any cryptocurrency comes with inherent risks and stablecoins are subject to some unique risks. Users of stablecoins expect that funds will be available and worth the amount promised should they wish to exchange their token for the underlying asset. They also expect that the funds will be safe from market impacts or business closure with the reserve assets being available for as long as that token remains in circulation. Popler differentiates itself from other stablecoins by leveraging the safety nets put in place for the traditional banking industry in the United States to mitigate the issues faced by other cryptocurrencies.

Maintaining Peg and Liquidity
Popler maintains its peg through the maintenance of a one-to-one reserve of USD for every Popler token in circulation. Other stablecoins invest their reserve in “equivalently valued assets” that risk decreasing the overall liquidity of the reserve. This can lead to a liquidity crisis where the stablecoin is unable to process token redemption requests from their users, risking their peg and potentially inciting a mass exodus out of the cryptocurrency market. By maintaining completely liquid reserves Popler will always be able to meet the demands of the users.

Insurance of Funds
After the Great Depression, the United States Federal Government set up deposit insurance policies for bank accounts held at accredited banks and credit unions. This insurance means that even if the underlying bank were to go bankrupt the customers will be compensated for the balance of their accounts. Under most circumstances this amount is $250,000 per account. Popler leverages this insurance offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insulate its USD reserves from issues in real-world banking institutions. Popler is further insulated from potential security breaches by spreading funds across multiple banks and credit unions. If one institution or account were to be compromised it would not compromise all of Popler’s USD reserves.

Legal and Compliance
Popler LLC is a limited liability company incorporated pursuant to the laws and regulations of the State of Delaware. Popler LLC is registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Popler LLC undertakes customer due diligence, record keeping, and
reporting procedures consistent with U.S. law.
